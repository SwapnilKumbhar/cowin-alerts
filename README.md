# Cowin Alert

A simple script to retrieve a list of Vaccination Centers in a certain district or (soon) pincode. This code powers our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/naCbehf86z), where people are notified about open vaccination slots in their district.

## TODOs

- [x] Move configurations to YAML
- [x] Make code more segregated
- [ ] Schema validation on YAML
- [ ] Pincode based alerts
